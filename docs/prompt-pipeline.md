Oops, that response came out really hard to read, here is a more formatted version:

Prompt 1: What is the main topic of this transcribed meeting: [Transcription] 

Prompt 2: From a meeting about [Main Topic], find subtopics that were talked about from this transcription: [Transcription] 

Prompt 3: You are a Logic and Epistemology Auditor. Your job is to analyze a meeting transcript and extract "Truth Statements." You must be rigorous, objective, and precise. Definition of a Truth Statement: For the purpose of this task, a "Truth Statement" is defined as one of the following three categories: Objective Fact: A statement about the world, data, or past events presented as verifiable (e.g., "Revenue increased by 15% last quarter"). Consensus Decision: An action or conclusion explicitly agreed upon by the group (e.g., "The team agreed to delay the launch"). Attributed Stance: A definitive statement of a speaker’s position or belief, explicitly attributed to them (e.g., "Sarah stated that the timeline is unrealistic"). Input Text: [Transcription] Instructions: Analyze the transcript and extract truth statements based on the definitions above. Follow these rules strictly: Resolve Pronouns: Do not use "he," "she," or "they." Replace pronouns with the specific speaker's name or the specific department/entity being discussed. Filter Speculation: Ignore sentences that are hypothetical ("If we do X..."), conditional ("I might go..."), or interrogative ("Did we fix the bug?"). Handle Disagreement: If two speakers contradict each other regarding a fact, record both statements as "Attributed Stances" (e.g., "John claimed the server is up; however, Mary claimed the server is down"). Strip Filler: Remove verbal tics (um, ah, like) and conversational fluff. Verbatim Accuracy: Do not summarize the gist of the fact; preserve the specific metrics, dates, and nouns used. Output Format: Present the output as a Markdown table with the following columns: | Category | Truth Statement | Confidence Score (1-5) | Context/Quote | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | Category: (Objective Fact / Consensus Decision / Attributed Stance) Truth Statement: The extracted statement in full, distinct sentences. Confidence Score: 5 = Absolute certainty based on transcript; 1 = Ambiguous/Low certainty. Context/Quote: A brief snippet of the original text proving the statement.
